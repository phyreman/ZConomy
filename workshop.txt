description=[h1]Main Features[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*]Adds right-click option to destroy Wallets for Money, as well as loot it from Purses
description=[*]Check Payphones, Arcade Cabinets, and Vending Machines for spare change
description=[*]Break open Payphones, Cash Registers, and Arcade Cabinets for large sums of Money with a Crowbar (*Tip: User Geronimo suggests clicking the checkout price display that sticks out from the top of the register, as it seems to work reliably.)
description=[*]Use the Money you've found to buy chips or soda from various vending machines. Grab them before the Zeds come!
description=[*]Spend some time playing an Arcade machine as a cheap, renewable way to relieve some boredom and unhappyness
description=[*]Use a Crowbar to break open the vending machines, but destroy some of the products inside. Don't forget to grab the cash, too!
description=[*]Using a Crowbar is very loud! Be careful of nearby zombies, or you might end up as a snack yourself!
description=[*]Completely configurable prices and loot amounts for all machines. Just look for the ZConomy.ini file in your <user>/Zomboid/Lua/ folder.
description=[*]Money can be split into other stacks by a percentage. (i.e. Right-click -> "Split Stack" -> "50/50 (50%)")
description=[*]Now compatible with existing saves! Just move the Money from one container to another. That's it!

description=[list]
description=[*]None at the moment. Cash Registers seem to be a bit easier to target after the 41.73 update, but please report any problems you get.
